Statistics and Data Science
============================

This is the start of a book for Statistics and Data Science course for Fall 2020 at NYU Physics.

Here are some of the objectives of this course:

 *  **Learn essential concepts of probability**<br />
Some text about why probability is important

 *  **Learn essential concepts of statistics**<br />
Some text about why statistics is important

 *  **Learn essential concepts of software and computing**<br />
Some text about why software and computing is important

 *  **Learn essential concepts of machine learning**<br />
Some text about why machine learning is important


In approaching this book I am torn between different styles. I like very much the atomic nature of [Quantum Field Theory by Mark Srednicki](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Field-Theory-Mark-Srednicki/dp/0521864496) as it is readible and a useful reference without too much narrative. On the other hand, I want to blend together the hands-on coding elements with fundamental concepts, and I am inspired by the book [Functional Differential Geometry by Gerald Jay Sussman and Jack Wisdom](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/functional-differential-geometry).
